# HeadCount 2.0

## Synopsis

This was a paired project designed to challenge our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components. We were tasked with importing data of educational stats from districts witin Colorado by year, per district. For iteration 0, we were giving test files to TDD our helper file, then we were in charge of building out the rest of the React components and write the appropriate tests. A user can filter through the school districts on the page using the search bar at the top of the application. A user can also click on the different distric cards to compare their averages. There is also a complete testing suite written in Jest and Enzyme. 

The project guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
